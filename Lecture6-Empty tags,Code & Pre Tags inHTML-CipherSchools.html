	My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;
	<br>
    Coral is far more red than her lips’ red;
    <br>
    If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
    <br>
    If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
    <br>
    I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
    <br>
    But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
    <br>
    And in some perfumes is there more delight
    <br>
    Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
    <br>
    That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
    <br>
    I grant I never saw a goddess go;
    <br>
    My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
    <br>
    And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
    <br>
    As any she belied with false compare.
    <br>
